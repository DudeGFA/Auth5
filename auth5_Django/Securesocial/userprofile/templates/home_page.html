        <h1>Welcome to Decentralized Social</h1>
        <p>This app was created as a sample of <span>Auth5</span> integration, serving as a third-party authentication
            system. It includes web pages to view user profiles containing Personal Identifiable Information (PII).</p>
        <p>To view a user's PII, you must either be the owner of the PII or be permitted by the PII owner on
            <span>Auth5</span> to view that particular PII. The PII owner grants permission using your
            <span>Auth5</span> User ID.</p>
        <a href="https://decentralizedsocial.pythonanywhere.com/login/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-info mt-2 mb-4">Click
            here to authenticate into Decentralized Social using <span>Auth5</span></a>
        <p>On successful login, you will be redirected to your profile on Decentralized Social.</p>
        <p>The values you see for the PII fields on your profile will be the data stored in your DWN.</p>
